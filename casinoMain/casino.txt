make a red center line
make a box
make multiple boxes,
label the boxes with numbers
make them "scroll out"
get a random number
"rotate them x amount of degrees depending on what is the number" (1 num box degree, * position)
set a rand variable for the scrolling animation
do a winning (green text)/ losing (red text) when the roll finishes


MISC
add a dark/light theme button 

It would be sick If It would be multiplayer so that I can play It with my buddies

BONUS (epic pro gamer move)

I could somehow use ajax so that instead of loading a shit ton of boxes I could just load more boxes when I scroll to left
that way I'd never run out of them and I woudn't need to center them again after rolling

I most likely need to append a new element and delete the first element so that I don't get too many elements
and i need AJAX for that


This is written after dark/light mode is done

Prevent user from betting when they have insufficient funds

I should also add my github on the navbar



// Plan for today, add a login system and a button to add cash
also this // I have to figure out how to prevent from betting with insufficient funds serverside

CREATE TABLE users (
	id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    pwd VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    funds INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 100,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

So everything is sick and all but I'll need to change a bunch of shit but that's good
I will need to read data from the database and have it displayed that way
Instead of updating it with js

I once challenged myself to email some of the smartest people in CS including Bjarne and Paul Graham. I ended up finding Bjarne’s email. This was early in my career and I asked for advice, 
and he responded: “Be a nice guy and support your colleagues. Try not to work on organizations where people are not nice to each other. Learn to communicate your ideas verbally and in writing”

In oreder for It to be even remotely secured I need to have the casino automatically roll, and the user can just place bets and wait for the server to roll
so Let's make a timer animation type thing

I managed to get the username in the $username variable with a session instead of
