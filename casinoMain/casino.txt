make a red center line
make a box
make multiple boxes,
label the boxes with numbers
make them "scroll out"
get a random number
"rotate them x amount of degrees depending on what is the number" (1 num box degree, * position)
set a rand variable for the scrolling animation
do a winning (green text)/ losing (red text) when the roll finishes


MISC
add a dark/light theme button 

It would be sick If It would be multiplayer so that I can play It with my buddies

BONUS (epic pro gamer move)

I could somehow use ajax so that instead of loading a shit ton of boxes I could just load more boxes when I scroll to left
that way I'd never run out of them and I woudn't need to center them again after rolling

I most likely need to append a new element and delete the first element so that I don't get too many elements
and i need AJAX for that


This is written after dark/light mode is done

Prevent user from betting when they have insufficient funds

I should also add my github on the navbar



// Plan for today, add a login system and a button to add cash
also this // I have to figure out how to prevent from betting with insufficient funds serverside

CREATE TABLE users (
	id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    pwd VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    funds INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 100,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

So everything is sick and all but I'll need to change a bunch of shit but that's good
I will need to just read shit from the database and have it written that way
Instead of updating it with js
